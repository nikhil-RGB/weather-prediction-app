> [!IMPORTANT]  
> <strong>PROJECT ABANDONED:</strong> Lack of communication with the backend and ML developers has forced this project's development to be temporarily paused. Until API endpoints are provided, the app will only show hardcoded 
  information.

## Usage 
 
The Cloudburst Prediction System Flutter app provides an intuitive user interface for users to access real-time cloudburst prediction data. Users can customize settings, view interactive maps, and receive push notifications for alerts.
